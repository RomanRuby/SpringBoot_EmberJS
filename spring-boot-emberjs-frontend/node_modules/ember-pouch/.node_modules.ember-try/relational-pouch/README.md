=====

```js
var db = new PouchDB('mydb');
db.setSchema([
  {singular: 'author', plural: 'authors', relations: { books: {hasMany: 'book'}}},
  {singular: 'book', plural: 'books', relations: {author: {belongsTo: 'author'}}}
]);
db.rel.save('author', {
  name: 'George R. R. Martin', id: 1, books: [6, 7]
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', { title: 'A Game of Thrones', id: 6, author: 1});
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {title: 'The Hedge Knight', id: 7, author: 1});
}).catch(console.log.bind(console));
```

Relational Pouch is a plugin for PouchDB that allows you to interact with PouchDB/CouchDB like a relational data store, with types and relations.

It provides an enhanced API on top of PouchDB that is probably more familiar to fans of relational databases, and maybe even easier to use. At the same time, though, you still have CouchDB's awesome indexing and sync capabilities.

This plugin also uses clever tricks to avoid creating secondary indexes. This means that even if you have complex entity relations, your database operations should still be very fast.

The main goal of this is to provide an API that is as similar to [Ember Data](http://emberjs.com/api/data/) and [json:api](http://jsonapi.org/) as possible, while still being performant and Pouch-like.

This plugin is largely what powers [Ember Pouch](https://github.com/pouchdb-community/ember-pouch).

Installation
------

### In the browser

Download from GitHub, or use Bower:

    bower install relational-pouch

Then include it after `pouchdb.js` in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="pouchdb.js"></script>
<script src="pouchdb.relational-pouch.js"></script>
```

### In Node.js

    npm install relational-pouch

And then attach it to the `PouchDB` object:

```js
var PouchDB = require('pouchdb');
PouchDB.plugin(require('relational-pouch'));
```

### db.setSchema(schema)

Call this after you initialize your PouchDB, in order to define your entities and relationships:

```js
var db = new PouchDB('mydb');
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'post',
    plural: 'posts',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: 'author'},
      comments: {hasMany: 'comment'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      posts: {hasMany: 'post'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'comment',
    plural: 'comments',
    relations: {
      post: {belongsTo: 'post'}
    }
  }
]);
```

This is a synchronous method that does not return a Promise.

You can define one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships using any combination of `belongsTo` and `hasMany` that you want. For more examples, read the [Ember guide to models](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/defining-models/), which is what inspired this.

You need to explicitly define the singular and plural forms of your entities, because I'm not a big fan of applying magic Anglocentric defaults to everything.

Once you call `setSchema`, your `db` will be blessed with a `rel` object, which is where you can start using the rest of this plugin's API.

#### documentType

Rarely, you might want to have two different views over the same underlying data. Use `documentType` to create a view which reads the same data as another type:

```js
var db = new PouchDB('mydb');
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'post',
    plural: 'posts',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: 'author'},
      comments: {hasMany: 'comment'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'postSummary',
    plural: 'postSummaries',
    documentType: 'post'
  }
]);
```

Here, when you load a "postSummary", it will return the same core record as "post", but will not resolve the relationships.

Be careful when using this feature â€” it is probably best to treat a type declaring a documentType as read-only. Do all creates/updates via the main type.

### db.rel.save(type, object)

Save an object with a particular type. This returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.save('post', {
  title: 'Rails is Omakase',
  text: 'There are a lot of a-la-carte software...'
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Omakase",
      "text": "There are a lot of a-la-carte software...",
      "id": "14760983-285C-6D1F-9813-D82E08F1AC29",
      "rev": "1-84df2c73028e5b8d0ae1cbb401959370"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you want, you can specify an `id`. Otherwise an `id` will be created for you.

```js
db.rel.save('post', {
  title: 'Rails is Unagi',
  text: 'Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.',
  id: 1
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Unagi",
      "text": "Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-0ae315ee597b22cc4b1acf9e0edc35ba"
    }
  ]
}
```

You'll notice the special field `rev`, which is a revision identifier. That'll come into play later.

`id` and `rev` are reserved fields when you use this plugin. You shouldn't try to use them for something else. An `id` can be any string or integer.

### db.rel.find(type)

Find all objects with a given type. Returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.find('post');
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Unagi",
      "text": "Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-0ae315ee597b22cc4b1acf9e0edc35ba"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rails is Omakase",
      "text": "There are a lot of a-la-carte software...",
      "id": "14760983-285C-6D1F-9813-D82E08F1AC29",
      "rev": "1-84df2c73028e5b8d0ae1cbb401959370"
    }
  ]
}
```

The list will be empty if it doesn't find anything. The results are sorted by `id`.

### db.rel.find(type, id)

Find an object with the given type and `id`. Returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.find('post', 1);
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Unagi",
      "text": "Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-0ae315ee597b22cc4b1acf9e0edc35ba"
    }
  ]
}
```

### db.rel.find(type, ids)

Find multiple objects with multiple `id`s. Returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.find('post', [3, 2, 1]);
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Unagi",
      "text": "Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-0ae315ee597b22cc4b1acf9e0edc35ba"
    },  
    {
      "title": "Maybe Rails is more like a sushi buffet",
      "text": "Heresy!",
      "id": 2,
      "rev": "1-6d8ac6d86d01b91cfbe2f53e0c81bb86"
    }
  ]
}
```

If an `id` isn't found, it's simply not returned. Notice that above, there is no object with an `id` of `3`.

`find` results are always returned ordered by id. The order of your `ids` array will not necessarily be reflected in the returned array of objects.

### db.rel.find(type, options)

Find all objects with a given type and limit the results via the passed in options.  Returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.find('post',{startkey: 1, limit: 2});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Rails is Unagi",
      "text": "Delicious unagi. Mmmmmm.",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-0ae315ee597b22cc4b1acf9e0edc35ba"
    },  
    {
      "title": "Maybe Rails is more like a sushi buffet",
      "text": "Heresy!",
      "id": 2,
      "rev": "1-6d8ac6d86d01b91cfbe2f53e0c81bb86"
    }
  ]
}
```
The following options based on the options for [PouchDB batch fetch](http://pouchdb.com/api.html#batch_fetch) are available:
* `startkey` & `endkey`:  Get documents with IDs in a certain range (inclusive/inclusive).
* `limit`: Maximum number of documents to return.
* `skip`: Number of docs to skip before returning (warning: poor performance on IndexedDB/LevelDB!).

### db.rel.del(type, object)

Deletes the given object. Returns a Promise.

```js
db.rel.del('post', {id:1, rev:"1-0560dbb11ead319c9f5bc1f667ea8e84"});
```

Result:

```js
{"deleted":true}
```

The minimum you need to delete something is an `id` and a `rev`. The easiest pattern is to just `find` it before deleting it:

```js
db.rel.find('post', 1).then(function (post) {
  return db.rel.del('post', post);
});
```

### db.rel.putAttachment(type, object, attachmentId, attachment, attachmentType)

Adds an attachment to the given object. Returns a Promise. See [PouchDB Attachments](http://pouchdb.com/guides/attachments.html) but note that `._attachments` is instead `.attachments` in relational-pouch.

```js
var attachment = new Blob(['Is there life on Mars?']);
// Or in Node.js: new Buffer('Is there life on Mars?')
db.rel.putAttachment('post', {id:1, rev:"1-..."}, 'file', attachment, 'text/plain');
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "attachments": {
        "file": {
          "content_type": "text/plain",
          "digest": "md5-1cz9JKh0i+1OLJonmitgiQ==",
          "length": 22,
          // ... http://pouchdb.com/guides/attachments.html
        }
      },
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "2-...."
    }
  ]
}
```

### db.rel.getAttachment(type, id, attachmentId)

Gets an attachment for the given document id. Returns a Promise to a Blob (or Buffer for Node).

```js
db.rel.getAttachment('post', 1, 'file').then(function (attachment) {
  // convert the Blob into an object URL and show it in an image tag
  $('img').attr('src', URL.createObjectURL(attachment));
});
```

### db.rel.removeAttachment(type, object, attachmentId)

Remove an attachment from the given object. Returns a Promise.

```js
var attachment = new Blob(['Is there life on Mars?']); // new Buffer('Is there life on Mars?') for node
db.rel.putAttachment('post', {id:1, rev:"1-0560dbb11ead319c9f5bc1f667ea8e84"}, 'file', attachment, 'text/plain').then(function (res) {
  var post = res.posts[0];
  db.rel.removeAttachment('post', post, 'file');
});
```

Or continuing from the `putAttachment` example:

```js
db.rel.removeAttachment('post', {id: 1, rev:"2-09d5c5bd86fc170c064b296773044ea9"} , 'file');
```

Result:

```js
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "3-...."
    }
  ]
}
```

### db.rel.parseDocID(docID)

Parses a raw CouchDB/PouchDB doc `_id` into an object containing a `type` and `id` field. Basically only useful for working with the `db.changes()` feed, so you can tell what changed from a "relational" perspective rather than from the raw CouchDB/PouchDB perspective.

This method is synchronous, so it directly returns the object rather than a Promise.

```js
db.rel.parseDocID("author_1_0000000000000019");
```

Returns:

```js
{
  "type": "author",
  "id": 19
}
```

So e.g. with `changes()` you could do:

```js
db.changes().then(function (changes) {
return changes.results.map(function (change) {
  return db.rel.parseDocID(change.id);
});
```

Result is e.g.:

```js
[
  {"type": "author", "id": 19},
  {"type": "book", "id": 1},
  {"type": "book", "id": 2},
  {"type": "book", "id": 3}
]
```

### db.rel.makeDocID(parsedID)

Creates a valid `_id` from an object with `type` and `id` properties, such as
`parseDocID` generates. The format is `<type>_<id type>_<id>`. The `<id type>` depends on the id. If the id is undefined the value is 0, if the id is a number, the value is 1, if the id is a string the value is 2, and if the id is an object the value is 3.

```js
db.rel.makeDocID({ "type": "author", "id": 123 });
// author_1_0000000000000123
db.rel.makeDocID({ "type": "author", "id": "onetwothree" });
// author_2_onetwothree
```

Useful if you need to perform operations with the underlying database, e.g.:

```js
var _id = db.rel.makeDocID({ "type": "author", "id": 19 });
db.get(_id).then(function (doc) {
  var parsedId = db.parseDocID(doc._id);
  doc.data.type = parsedId.type;
  doc.data.id = parsedId.id;
  return doc.data;
});
```

### db.rel.parseRelDocs(type, pouchDocs)

Parses pouch documents that should be in this schema. Loads extra relations if needed.
This function is useful when you are loading data from db.find for example, instead of from db.rel.

Example:
```js
db.find(selector).then(function (data) {
  return db.rel.parseRelDocs(type, data.docs);
});
```

Returns data as [`db.rel.find(type)`](#dbrelfindtype) would return it.

It requires a type parameter, which could be gotten from the id of the first document using [`db.rel.parseDocID(docID)`](#dbrelparsedociddocid), but most of the time you will know which type you are trying to find with the db.find call.

### db.rel.findHasMany(type, belongsToKey, belongsToId)

Uses db.find to build a selector that searches for the documents of type `type` that have a value of `belongsToId` set in the field `belongsToKey`.
This can be used in a higher level API to use asynchronous hasMany relations that don't store the hasMany side.

Example:
```js
db.rel.findHasMany('post', 'author', '1');
```

Returns a Promise that will resolve to an array of posts that have author 1 as [`db.rel.find(type)`](#dbrelfindtype) would.

Since db.find requires the use of indexes, you need to setup an index for this extra lookup. The fields required by this index are `_id` and the field specified in the `belongsToKey`, prefixed with `data.`. The `_id` field is used to filter the related items by type. Without it another type with the same field could also be returned.
So the example above would give:

```
db.createIndex({index: { fields: ['data.author', '_id'] }});
```

For performance reasons the queried field is used first here. As this is to be expected to return a smaller set that filtering on type first.
If your database however has a lot more document types that has data.author fields too, you may find that switching the order and using `id` as the first filter will give faster results.

### Managing relationships

Entity relationships are encoded using the [Ember Data Model](http://andycrum.github.io/ember-data-model-maker/) format, which is a slight simplification of [json:api](http://jsonapi.org/).

#### One-to-one relationships

An author has exactly one profile, and vice-versa:

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      'profile': {belongsTo: 'profile'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'profile',
    plural: 'profiles',
    relations: {
      'author': {belongsTo: 'author'}
    }
  }
]);

db.rel.save('author', {
  name: 'Stephen King',
  id: 19,
  profile: 21
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('profile', {
    description: 'nice masculine jawline',
    id: 21,
    author: 19
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.find('author');
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Stephen King",
      "profile": 21,
      "id": 19,
      "rev": "1-bf705a912bf672b30ad262b33a19c5c3"
    }
  ],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "description": "nice masculine jawline",
      "author": 19,
      "id": 21,
      "rev": "1-ef86a08ea3243ea59302ceaa04afd59f"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Many-to-one relationships

An author has many books:

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      'books': {hasMany: 'book'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'book',
    plural: 'books',
    relations: {
      'author': {belongsTo: 'author'}
    }
  }
]);

db.rel.save('author', {
  name: 'Stephen King',
  id: 19,
  books: [1]
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('author', {
    name: 'George R. R. Martin',
    id: 1,
    books: [6, 7]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'It',
    id: 1,
    author: 19
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'A Game of Thrones',
    id: 6,
    author: 1
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'The Hedge Knight',
    id: 7,
    author: 1
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.find('author');
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "George R. R. Martin",
      "books": [
        6,
        7
      ],
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-04e165889a4a9303a6dc07a54cee9741"
    },
    {
      "name": "Stephen King",
      "books": [
        1
      ],
      "id": 19,
      "rev": "1-38580117cb4a1ddb2c7151453a7f9129"
    }
  ],
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "It",
      "author": 19,
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-1b7ea74936a8034aee7da27ffd36a63f"
    },
    {
      "title": "A Game of Thrones",
      "author": 1,
      "id": 6,
      "rev": "1-a6f0dc69fc79d5565639074b5defa52d"
    },
    {
      "title": "The Hedge Knight",
      "author": 1,
      "id": 7,
      "rev": "1-4988aa3215070c71e1505a05f90bb60f"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Many-to-many relationships

Peter Straub actually co-wrote *The Talisman* with Stephen King. So a book can have many authors, and an author can have many books:

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      'books': {hasMany: 'book'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'book',
    plural: 'books',
    relations: {
      'authors': {hasMany: 'author'}
    }
  }
]);

db.rel.save('author', {
  name: 'Stephen King',
  id: 19,
  books: [1, 2]
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('author', {
    name: 'Peter Straub',
    id: 2,
    books: [2, 3]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'It',
    id: 1,
    authors: [19]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'The Talisman',
    id: 2,
    authors: [19, 2]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    title: 'Ghost Story',
    id: 3,
    authors: [2]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.find('author');
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Peter Straub",
      "books": [
        2,
        3
      ],
      "id": 2,
      "rev": "1-92901c8e3e0775765777bfcbe8f4c2dd"
    },
    {
      "name": "Stephen King",
      "books": [
        1,
        2
      ],
      "id": 19,
      "rev": "1-d70d9fe033f583493029372c88ae21d0"
    }

#### Async relationships

Just like with Ember Data, you can define relationships to be *async*, which means that dependent objects aren't automatically sideloaded. This can reduce your request time and payload size.

For instance, let's say you want to load all authors, but you don't want to load their books, too. You can do:

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      books: {hasMany: {type: 'book', options: {async: true}}}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'book',
    plural: 'books',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: {type: 'author', options: {async: true}}}
    }
  }
]);
```

By default, `async` is consider `false`. So this:

```js
...
  books: {hasMany: 'book'}
...
```

is equivalent to this:

```js
...
  books: {hasMany: {type: 'book', options: {async: false}}}
...
```

Now let's try with `{async: true}`. You'll notice that, when we fetch the list of authors, only the book `id`s will be included, not the full books:

```js
return db.rel.save('author', {
  name: 'Stephen King',
  id: 19,
  books: [1, 2, 3]
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    id: 1,
    title: 'The Gunslinger'
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    id: 2,
    title: 'The Drawing of the Three'
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', {
    id: 3,
    title: 'The Wastelands'
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.find('author');
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Stephen King",
      "books": [
        1,
        2,
        3
      ],
      "id": 19,
      "rev": "1-9faf8c4f72db782dacce16a7849d156b"
    }
  ]
}
```

This can cut down on your request size, if you don't need the full book information when you fetch authors.

#### Don't save hasMany

By default relational-pouch will store the child ids of an Many-to-one relationship as a property on the many side (the parent). This can lead to extra conflicts, since this goes against the normal "documents are changes" way that Couch works best. Edits to documents are best to be self contained, and changing a parent document because a child is inserted can result in problems with multiple users.

A way to fix this is to specify to relational-pouch that the parent actually does not store this array of children. But instead relational-pouch should use a db.find query to search for them.

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      books: {hasMany: {type: 'book', options: {queryInverse: 'author'}}}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'book',
    plural: 'books',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: 'author'}
    }
  }
]);
```

This will tell relational-pouch to not save the book ids on the author, and use a query using db.find to look for the related books.
Since this uses [`db.rel.findHasMany(type, type, belongsToKey, belongsToId)`](#dbrelfindhasmanytype-belongstokey-belongstoid) internally, you also need an index as specified there, where `belongsToKey` is the field specified in the `queryInverse` option.

For async relations this queryInverse will not work at this moment and the child id array will not be present on the result. You can use the [`db.rel.findHasMany(type, type, belongsToKey, belongsToId)`](#dbrelfindhasmanytype-belongstokey-belongstoid) for this scenario instead.
If you also don't give relational-pouch the child ids when calling db.rel.save you could also completely remove the hasMany side of the relation from the schema .

#### Advanced

Deeply nested relationships are also possible. Everything just ends up being sideloaded in the same JSON object response.

```js
{
  "lions" : [...],
  "tigers" : [...],
  "bears" : [...]
}
```

When you `save`, you must explicitly provide the `id`s of dependent objects, and they must be saved independently. There is no cascading at all.

You can attach the full entity object with an `id` to another object, but if you include an object without an `id`, it will be ignored.

```js
db.setSchema([
  {
    singular: 'author',
    plural: 'authors',
    relations: {
      profile: {belongsTo: 'profile'},
      books: {hasMany: 'books'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'profile',
    plural: 'profiles',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: 'author'}
    }
  },
  {
    singular: 'book',
    plural: 'books',
    relations: {
      author: {belongsTo: 'author'}
    }
  }
]);

var profile = {
  description: 'nice masculine jawline',
  id: 21,
  author: 19
};
var book1 = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'The Gunslinger'
};
var book2 = {
  id: 2,
  title: 'The Drawing of the Three'
};
var book3 = {
  id: 3,
  title: 'The Wastelands'
};
db.rel.save('profile', profile).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', book1);
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', book2);
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('book', book3);
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.save('author', {
    name: 'Stephen King',
    id: 19,
    profile: profile,
    books: [book1, book2, book3]
  });
}).then(function () {
  return db.rel.find('author');
});
```

Result:

```js
{
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Stephen King",
      "profile": 21,
      "books": [
        1,
        2,
        3
      ],
      "id": 19,
      "rev": "1-308a75619dc1b96bece7b6996d36d18b"
    }
  ],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "description": "nice masculine jawline",
      "author": 19,
      "id": 21,
      "rev": "1-7bd39e62046a0816f9c5a3836a548ec8"
    }
  ],
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "The Gunslinger",
      "id": 1,
      "rev": "1-f3a305eae85642ce74412141ec0ae0bf"
    },
    {
      "title": "The Drawing of the Three",
      "id": 2,
      "rev": "1-1c94deba48af8c1c2df1c5545246846b"
    },
    {
      "title": "The Wastelands",
      "id": 3,
      "rev": "1-a4a96e3f9e2cb3d516605fa46bbed080"
    }
  ]
}
```

The plugin is not smart enough to infer bidirectional relationships, so you have to attach the relation to both object. E.g. in the above example, each `book` explicitly has its `author` set, and the `author` explicitly has his `books` set. If you want to add a new book, you would need to `save()` the book, add it to the author's list of books, and then `save()` the author.


### Managing revisions ("rev")

When you update an existing object, you'll need to include the `rev`, or else you'll get a 409 conflict error. This is standard CouchDB/PouchDB behavior, so the common idiom is:

```js
db.rel.find('post', 1).then(function (res) {
  // do whatever you want to do to update the post
  return db.rel.save('post', res.posts[0]).catch(function (err) {
    if (err.code === 409) { // conflict
      // handle the conflict somehow. e.g. ask the user to compare the two versions,
      // or just try the whole thing again
    } else {
      throw err; // some other error
    }
  });
});
```

This also applies to deletions:

```js
db.rel.find('post', 1).then(function (res) {
  return db.rel.del('post', res.posts[0]).catch(function (err) {
    if (err.code === 409) { // conflict
      // handle the conflict
    } else {
      throw err; // some other error
    }
  });
});
```

To avoid getting into a long discussion of why you have to do this: suffice it to say, when you build a client-server sync architecture, you are building a *distributed system*. Distributed systems are hard, and managing conflicts is just a reality when you have multiple computers that aren't perfectly in sync.

You will have to deal with conflicts sooner or later. With PouchDB and CouchDB, you simply pay that cost up-front.

Jan Lenhardt has [a nice writeup](http://writing.jan.io/2013/12/19/understanding-couchdb-conflicts.html) on this.

### Attachments

Thanks to [bterkuile](https://github.com/bterkuile), this plugin also support attachments! Attachments are simply added inline, in the normal PouchDB way, but as

```
doc.attachments
```

rather than

```
doc._attachments
```

I.e. It follows the same convention as `doc.id` and `doc.rev`.

How does it work?
-----

A relational Pouch/Couch is just a regular database that has been partitioned by type.

So for instance, a document with type `"pokemon"` and id `"1"` might have an actual `_id` like `"pokemon_1"`, whereas a `"trainer"` with id `"2"` might have an actual `_id` like `"trainer_2"`. It's not rocket science.

What is important is that this plugin leverages the very efficient `allDocs()` API, rather than the slower `query()` API. Also, it joins related documents by simply making extra requests, rather than using native map/reduce joined documents. And it's smart enough to group the requests, so the data is fetched in the fewest posisble number of requests.

Although this method may seem naÃ¯ve, in practice you get much better performance, because building secondary indexes in Pouch/Couch takes quite a bit of time. Whereas if you just use `allDocs()`, it uses the built-in index on `_id`, so you don't have to wait for an index to be built.

Testing
----

### In Node

This will run the tests in Node using LevelDB:

    npm test

You can also check for 100% code coverage using:

    npm run coverage

If you don't like the coverage results, change the values from 100 to something else in `package.json`, or add `/*istanbul ignore */` comments.


If you have mocha installed globally you can run single test with:
```
TEST_DB=local mocha --reporter spec --grep search_phrase
```

The `TEST_DB` environment variable specifies the database that PouchDB should use (see `package.json`).

### In the browser

Run `npm run dev` and then point your favorite browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8001/test/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8001/test/index.html).

The query param `?grep=mysearch` will search for tests matching `mysearch`.

### Automated browser tests

You can run e.g.

    CLIENT=selenium:firefox npm test
    CLIENT=selenium:phantomjs npm test

This will run the tests automatically and the process will exit with a 0 or a 1 when it's done. Firefox uses IndexedDB, and PhantomJS uses WebSQL.
